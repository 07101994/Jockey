# Jockey
Jockey is a music player for Android based on Google's Material Design standards. The point of Jockey is to be a simple, lightweight media player for the average user.

Also, Jockey was coded by a college student with only one semester of Computer Science. That being said, if you decide to modify Jockey, I apologize in advance.

### Downloads
No builds of Jockey are currently available for download. To install Jockey at the moment, you will need to compile it.
