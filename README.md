# Jockey
Jockey is a music player for Android based on Google's Material Design standards. The point of Jockey is to be a simple, lightweight media player designed for normal people (meaning that if you need an EQ, gapless playback, crossfade, or replay gain, Jockey probably isn't for you).

Also, Jockey was coded by a college student with only one semester of Computer Science. That being said, if you decide to modify Jockey, I apologize in advance.

### Downloads

### Bugs & contributing
Feel free to post suggestions, crashes, or just anything that isn't as smooth as it should be to the bug tracker -- I want Jockey to be as seamless as it possibly can. Additionally, don't hesitate to fork Jockey or submit a pull request -- especially if it's a bug fix or cleans up code that's doing mischevious, devious or otherwise bad things that I'm not aware of.
